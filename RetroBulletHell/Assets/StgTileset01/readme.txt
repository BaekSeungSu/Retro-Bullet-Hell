"Retro STG tileset" series is suitale for low resolution retro style STG games.(vertical scroller type)
Each sprite was drawn by only 4 colors.(sepia tone)


Reference player machine size is 16x16 pixels (width x height).


"sample.png" is sample image of combination. (This png is not sprite sheet).




<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing each level.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")
