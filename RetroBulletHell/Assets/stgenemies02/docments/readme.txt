Thanks for your purchase.


"retro STG enemies 02" is sprite set for low resolution retro style 2D shooter.(vertical scroll type)
Each sprite was drawn by only 4 colors.(like a game of old portable machine)

This asset is a series of "pixel art set of enemies vol.001 for retro type 2D shooter".
I changed series name.(because previous series name is so long)




"en.png" is a sprite sheet of enemies.(and some sprite is for effect such as explosion)




In "document" folder , there are some pictures for explanation of each sprite.(These pictures are not sprite sheet.)


"pt.png" is a picture of various pieces.
You can create new enemy sprite by assembling these pieces in drawing software.
There are some pieces for big size boss.




This asset is relation with the following asset.

-"Basic pixel art for retro 2D shooter" asset.(this asset is free)
-"Retro sprite font and icons" asset.(this asset is free)
-"retro shooting tileset vol.01" asset.($5)






<caution> 

1. about pixels per unit(PPU)


In this asset , default pixels per unit(PPU) of each spritesheet is 15.9 .

If you have pixel perfect script (for camera and for each object) ,you had better change PPU from 15.9 to 16 before you begin constructing each level.



2.about true color

Parency bug occurs in current version of unity when you use png image in [16bit] setting,so use png image in [true color] setting. 
(default setting of this asset is "true color")
